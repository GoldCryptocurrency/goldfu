How to solo-mine using the Gold Cryptocurrency wallet
1. Start wallet then go to Help > Debug window > Console
2. Type "setgenerate true -1" (without the "")
		true = means you want to mine coins, otherwise type "false" to stop mining
		-1 = means you want to use all the cores of your computer to mine Gold Cryptocurrency, 
				 otherwise type the specific amount of core you want to be focused on mining (e.g. 1 or 8)
3. Type "getmininginfo" to check the current block height, your hashes per second, etc.
4. Once you are mining successfully, the mining icon will glow
